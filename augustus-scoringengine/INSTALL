0. Get
Check out from Subversion.  The entire project can be checkout via:

    $ svn co http://augustus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/  augustus-trunk

Alternatively, you may want just the scoring engine (the tests require an
additional 1.5 GB and the examples are in the 10s of MBs):

    $ svn co http://augustus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/augustus-scoringengine \
        augustus-scoringengine

Make sure you have Python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 installed as well as numPy.  We
recommend Python 2.7 with NumPy 1.5.1.

1. Install
There are two standard ways of using Augustus:

Run from source
--- ---- ------
Set the appropriate environment variables.  For example:

If augustus-scoringengine is in /home/odg, then add the following lines to your
.bashrc (or similar) file:

    AUGUSTUS_HOME=/home/odg/augustus/augustus-scoringengine
    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${AUGUSTUS_HOME}
    export  PATH=${PATH}:${AUGUSTUS_HOME}/augustus/bin

No compilation or setup step is necessary.

Python Install
------ -------
You can also use setup.py.   By default, all files are installed to locations
already in PATH and PYTHONPATH.

From the Augustus directory, run:

    $ python setup.py install

The installation destination can be modified by using options such as --prefix.
You may have to set environmental variables if the location used in not in the
paths by default.  Run

    $ python setup.py --help

for a list of other options.

2. Examples
If you checked out augustus-examples, then you can test your Augustus
installation by following either of the examples.  There are READMEs
provided with the email and gaslog examples.

3. Questions
