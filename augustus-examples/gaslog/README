gaslog examples (Introduces Augustus)
=====================================

This example shows how to do the following things:

    * consume a model

    * post-process output data

    * produce a model

The directories
---------------

The directory structure is:

    gaslog
    ├── advanced
    ├── data 
    ├── introductory
    └── README

The "advanced" directory contains a readme that walks
an advanced user through producing, consuming, post-processing,
and some of Augustus's PMML editing tools.

The "data" directory contains the gaslog data that will
be used for both the "advanced" and the "introductory" examples.

The "introductory" directory is meant to be used in conjunction
with Augustus's primer. The primer walks a novice user
through producing, consuming, and post-processing.  The novice
user does not need to be familiar with Python or PMML.
